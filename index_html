    <abbr title=" What's up?">www</abbr> Sea Turtles


    <p>
      Green sea turtles are unique among <b> Sea turtles </b> sea turtles in <em> that </em>that they are primarily herbivores, eating mostly seagrasses and
      algae. This diet is what gives the
      ir cartilage and fat a greenish color (not their shells),<br> which is where
      their
      name comes from. They usually <b><em><u> What's up?</u></em></b>lay 100-125 eggs per nest and will nest multiple times, about two weeks apart, over
      several months. As soon as the eggs hatch (roughly 2 months later), the hatchlings dig out of their nest. This
      process generally takes a few days. Once they emerge, the tiny turtles hurry to the sea and make their way
      offshore
      into the open ocean. Sea turtles face many threats, but those that survive to become adults are decades old.

    Sea turtles are cool &gt; jellyfish are super cool too  &lt;
